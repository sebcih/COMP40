                - intFloatConvert.c
                        Purpose: To convert between integer and floating 
                                        point values

                - rgbYConvert.c
                        Purpose: To convert between RGB and component video 
                                        color space

                - wordPack.c
                        Purpose: To pack together a code word or take one 
                                apart
                       
                - YABCDConvert.c
                        Purpose: To convert between Y (luminance/luma) values
                                and cosine coefficients a, b, c, and d

        Part B:
                - bitpack.c
                        Purpose: To pack, unpack, and manipulate sets of bits

Overall architecture:

- 40image.c is the interface that interacts with a user.  It calls on 
        compress40.c or decompress40.c based on what the user wants to do

        - compress40.c is the interface that compresses an image
                - To compress an image:
                        - uses intFloatConvert.c to change to floating point
                                 representation
                        - uses rgbYConvert.c to transform each pixel from 
                                RGB color space to component video color 
                                space (YPbPr)
                        - uses pack.c to pack together code words from each 
                                2x2 block of pixels

        - decompress40.c is the interface that decompresses an image
                - To decompress an image:
                        - uses unpack.c to unpack each code word that is 
                                read in
                        - uses rgbYConvert.c to transform each pixel from
                                component video color space (YPbPr) to RGB 
                                color space
                        - uses intFloatConvert.c to change to integer 
                                representation

        - pack.c is the interface that packs together a code word
                - To do so:
                        - uses YABCDConvert.c to transform Y (luminance) 
                                values of pixels into cosine coefficients 
                                a, b, c, d
			- uses wordPack.c to pack together a code word
				(which in turn uses bitpack.c)

        - unpack.c is the interface that unpacks a given code word
                - To do so:
			- uses wordPack.c to take apart a code word
				(which in turn uses bitpack.c)
                        - uses YABCDConvert.c to transform cosine 
                                coefficients a, b, c, d, in to Y 
                                (luminance) values of pixels
